My name is Aditya - pronounced (Ah-dith-yuh). Some people call me by my last name, Khowal, but either works for me. I am a student at the University of Washington who is passionate about computer science. This website is one of my projects on my github. I am currently looking for roles in software engineering and machine learning.

Previously I have worked at:
- Amazon
- University of Missouri
- Bond Intelligence

Besides my academic background, I am a photographer, ex-swimmer, and love to explore new things! I love coffee and watching criminal minds on hulu. Checkout my resume, github and linkedin below!
