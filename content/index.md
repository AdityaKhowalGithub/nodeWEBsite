## About Me
Welcome to my portfolio! I'm a passionate software developer and researcher currently pursuing a degree in Informatics at the University of Washington. I have a strong interest in AI, machine learning, and full-stack development. When I'm not coding, you can find me climbing, making short films, or working as a photographer and videographer for weddings.
