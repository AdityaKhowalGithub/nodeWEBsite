Hello yall! This is my first week of using this website since migrating from my old portfolio [website](https://adityakh.info/).

I moved over to this website as it is the same platform as I note take and is ***SUPER*** easy to <u>deploy</u>. I don't think it's talked about enough how understated CI/CD is especially for solo developer projects like this, where the main task is to just tell the world about me.

I realized that my old portfolio was... really tacky... and as I was trying to update it, I was hitting my head on a wall with firebase issues. I needed a fresh start. And that is what this is.


Plus I got a much cooler domain.
